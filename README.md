This is a program to emulate a PS/2 keyboard and PS/2 mouse so that a
Raspberry Pi can act as the keyboard and mouse of another
computer. Mostly for use with a video capture device so that a
Raspberry Pi can act as a IP KVM.

There is no video capture stuff here, this is **only** PS/2 keyboard &
mouse emulation.

This also does not allow you to connect a PS/2 keyoard or mouse *to* a
Raspberry Pi, it lets the Pi be the keyboard and mouse. This feature
may be included in a future version though.
